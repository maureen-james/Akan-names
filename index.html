                This is a website to help generate Akan Names based on day of the week a child is born as is the Akan culture.
                The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. 
                These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. 
                Below are the different names given to male and female children on different days of the week they are born.
